Go Fish
-------

Go fish is a game which gives two players 7 random cards out of a deck. The player
whose turn it is to play asks the other player if they have a card (number or face)
that they have in their group of cards. If the other player has a matching card(s),
they must hand them over to the asking player. If not, the asking player picks up a
card from the deck. The point of the game is collect more sets of 4 cards than
your oponent.
